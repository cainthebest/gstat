## Goals

- [ ] Create a standard for the main aspects of a game server query (e.g. protocol, query, response, etc).
- [ ] Insure that the standard is flexible enough to be used for all types of games (With the exception of games that use a proprietary protocol that cannot be reverse engineered or games that do not use a query/response system).
- [ ] Stick to a modular design that allows for easy addition of new games, protocols, and tools.
- [ ] Support FFI for use in other languages (e.g. Dynamic libraries for C/C++, bindings for other languages, etc).
- [ ] Create a CLI tool that can be used to query game servers and display the results.
- [ ] Have our own documentation for game protocols and queries, so that we do not have to rely on other sources that may not be accurate or up to date.
