# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest minor versions will receive security updates. When a new minor version is released, the previous version will no longer be supported. For example, if the current version is `2.3.x`, the `2.2.x` version will not be supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our software seriously. If you think you've found a security vulnerability, we encourage you to notify us.

Please email us at cainthebest@pm.me with as many details as possible about the potential vulnerability. We will acknowledge your email as soon as we can, and we'll strive to send a more detailed response to your report within a reasonable amount of time. 

For a detailed guide on how to report vulnerabilities, please visit this link: 
[Reporting a Vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)

You may also use GitHub's built-in security advisory feature. This allows us to discuss the issue and work on a fix collaboratively. We kindly ask you to refrain from revealing the issue publicly before we had a chance to fix it.

### Do:

* Email us with as many details as you can. 
* Set the subject as "VULNERABILITY REPORT"
* Include a proof-of-concept or an explanation of the potential damage, if any.

### Don't:

* Include sensitive information in the issue itself. Please use email or GitHub's security advisory feature to report the vulnerability.
* Disclose the vulnerability publicly before we've addressed it.

Thank you for helping us ensure the security of our software. Your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings are appreciated and will be acknowledged.
